### Functionalities

Holds all the logic for the website basic functionalities.

- Home: The home page displays the topics (categories for the papers), the collections the user has created and the user's favorites (topics mainly but tags also). It displays also recent and relevant papers (most viewed) papers in the new papers publications.

To do: We need to add in the for you content designed specifically through the user search history, favorite topics, tags (which he chose explicitly) and through his actual preferences in navigation (based on search history)

- Profile: The user can access his settings (profile page) where he can see information he has entered for his account creation but most importantly his publications, followers, notifications etc...

- Profile editing: The user can edit his user informations

To do: Nothing at the moment


- Notifications: The notification page record all his notifications (viewed and not viewed at any time since account creation)

To do: Create a way to view notifications by chunks of 20 or 30 instead of loading all of them right away

- Publication: Publication view logic. Here the user can see a publication, his abstract etc..., can create a discussion in the publication, add publication to a collection (may it be an existing collection or one he will create on the spot).

To do: Create a contact authors functionality, complete discussion thread, update publication (need specific authorizations)

- Publication form: Publishing logic. All required fields for a new publication to be posted

To do: Created files for the Noxa authors policy and other blog topics

- Discussion: Related only to a specific publication, users can create discussion on a question they have for a publication

To do: Improve the discussion tab overall

- Collection: Collection has bundles of publication that user created for rapid access to publication he likes

To do: Nothing at the moment
